Pynches-Juegos is a set of games written in Python with the intention of teaching the first steps in the world of programming for all those programming enthusiasts or students who have not had prior contact with the world of programming.

The codes are designed to be developed in an introductory programming course and built step by step, explaining basic programming concepts.

The games can also be downloaded and modified for whatever purposes you have or simply to have fun for a while.

The philosophy of this project is to keep each of the games that are integrated as simple as possible, taking care that they are easy to read and can be understood with basic concepts.

The goal is that each code can be understood after having taken a basic programming course in any language (preferably python) and, if possible, some enterprising beginning programmers can modify it, extend it and make it their own.

Enjoy!
